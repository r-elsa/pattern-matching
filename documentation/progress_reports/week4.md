## Progress report week 4 (10.4 - 16.4)

**This week I have** researched and implemented the suffix trie and a method to look if a substring includes in a string. Due to 

**The project has progressed** well. 

**This week I learned** implementation of suffix trie with adjacency lists. 

**Something that is unclear:** see questions. 

**Next up, I will** create tests for the suffix trie implementation. Start implementing the suffix tree. 

**Questions: 

Any suggestions on how to solve the problem that I currently have with space: The data that I retrieved from NY times API on 14/4 included 487 words (3,337 characters) and the vector datastructure cannot bear the amount of data (adjacency lists).
