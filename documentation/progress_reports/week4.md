## Progress report week 4 (10.4 - 16.4)

**This week I have** researched and implemented the suffix trie and a method to look if a word includes in the data extracted from NY Times. 

**The project has progressed** well. 

**This week I learned** implementation of suffix trie with adjacency lists. 

**Something that is unclear:** see questions. 

**Next up, I will** create tests for the suffix tree implementation and the word search.

**Questions: 

Any suggestions on how to solve the problem that I currently have with space: The data that I retrieved from NY times API on 14/4 included 487 words (3,337 characters) and the vector datastructure cannot bear the amount of data (adjacency lists). One solution I can currently think of is sorting the words in alphabetical order and create multiple suffiex tries, e.g. a-j, i-r, s-z. Another solution is to not use adjacency lists and instead only index of parent node.
