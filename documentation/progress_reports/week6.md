## Progress report week 6 (23 - 30.4.)

**This week I have** finished autocomplete feature, refactored code in preparation for unittests, written a few unittests and researched header files.

**The project has progressed** a little bit.

**This week I learned** about how to print each word (root to node) in a suffixtrie, how to build a vector in a recursive function and about header files.

**Something that is unclear:**  please see questions.

**Next up, I will** write header files,  more unittests and a lot of documentation.

**Questions:** 

-I would appreciate help with how to write the header files includes/apicall.h , includes/logic.h and includes/suffixtrie.h. as it is apparently good practise to write header files in C++ and not include .cpp files. The classes and functions are already very intertwined and I am struggling especially with classes.

- Is a UI necessary? Or command prompt enough?
