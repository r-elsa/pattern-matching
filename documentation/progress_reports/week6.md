## Progress report week 5 (17.4 - 23.4)

**This week I have** finished autocomplete feature, refactored code in preparation for unittests and researched header files.

**The project has progressed** a little bit, currently I would need a little bit of help with writing header files.

**This week I learned** about how to print each word (root to node) in a suffixtree, how to build a vector in a recursive function and about header files.

**Something that is unclear:**  please see questions.

**Next up, I will** write header files and unittests.

**Questions:** 
-I would really appreciate help with how to write the header files includes/apicall.h , includes/logic.h and includes/suffixtrie.h. while it is apparently good practise to write header files in C++ it would also solve my problem with the *main* function in *main.cpp* and the *main* function in *tests/trie_test.cpp*. 
The classes and functions are already very intertwined.
- Is a UI necessary? Or command prompt enough?
