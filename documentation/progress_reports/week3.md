## Progress report week 3

**This week I have** implemented json-parsing and string splitting.

**The project has progressed** well, despite not having a lot of time to allocate for the project.  

**This week I learned** about JsonCpp, string splitting and CppLint library. 

**Something that is unclear:** Currently tasks are clear.

**Next up, I will** 1. add unit tests for the current code 2. add code coverage 3. research and implement suffix tree. 

**Questions:*
