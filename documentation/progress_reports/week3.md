## Progress report week 3

**This week I have** implemented json-parsing, string splitting and added a static analysis tool- Cppcheck.

**The project has progressed** well, yet having some challenges in configuring the unit test library.  

**This week I learned** about JsonCpp, string splitting and Cppcheck library. Basics of unittesting in C++.

**Something that is unclear:** see Questions

**Next up, I will** 1. try another unit testing library  2. add code coverage 3. research and implement suffix tree. 

**Questions: 
What type of unit testing should be done on API call and json parsng? 
While the tests do not work due to configuration issues/ library not being updated anymore, I would appreciate feedback on the tests.
