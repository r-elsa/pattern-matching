## Progress report week 1

**This week I have** familiarized with the course page and chosen a topic. 

**The project has progressed** a little bit. The requirement specification helps in finding out the details of the project.

**This week I learned** general information about tree-like datastructures.

**Something that is unclear:** please see questions below 

**Next up, I will** implement all datastructures and if time allows, methods for solving problem 1. 

**Questions:**
I would very happily receive feedback /suggestions on 
  - tree-like data structures well suited for string manipulation
  - suitable problems that most (if not all) of the chosen datastuctures can solve.
  - algorithms for solving the problems
  - project scope as it is at the moment
