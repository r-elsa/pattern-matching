### Progress report week 1

I am continuing the project from period IV in 2023 by adding the implemention of a suffix tree with Ukkonen's algorithm. Ukkonen's algorithm builds the tree in linear time and the tree grows in linear space (as oppose to the trie, which grows in quadratic space). This week I have researched the datastructure of a suffix tree and the Ukkonen's algorithm in more depth: implicit suffix trees, suffix links and the 4 variables that I need to store (node, edge, length and remainder) as well as understanding the working of the algorithm.
