## Progress report week 2

**This week I have** familiarized with pattern matching data structures and algorithms.

**The project has progressed** well. The topic is relatively clear and I have implemented the feature of accessing data from the REST API.

**This week I learned** about c++ libraries such as *curl* and *nlohman/json*. 

**Something that is unclear:** Currently everything is going quite smoothly.

**Next up, I will** parse the json data and start working on the suffix trie. 

**Questions:*
API key in README.md OK?
commenting style ?
