# Requirement specification

## Aim of project:

The goal of the project is to get to know new and challenging data structures that apply the structure of a tree. The objects of comparison are four different datastructures (trees) and four different problems, and to investigate which algorithm is the best in which problem situation. Possibly, the data structures are also ranked based on their suitability.

## Language:

- C++
- Lanuages I can peer review: C++, python

## Scope of the project:

### The four data structures to be compared:
**1) Segment tree** 
  - yy
  - Time complexity: yy
  
**2) Cartesian tree** 
  - yy
  - Time complexity: yy
  
**3) Treap**
  - Combines binary tree and binary heap.
  - Time complexity: O(log n)
  
**4) XX**
  - yy
  - Time complexity: yy

### 4 different problems that data structures help to solve.
1) Calculating the sum of the interval.
2) Searching most popular node.
3) Changin node to user input.
4) Measuring the distance between two nodes.
5) Switching two nodes.


###  Which data structure is best for each problem? The comparison includes:
- time complexity
- execution time in milliseconds
- space complexity
- ease of implementation

### Algorithms I will use:

DFS,
